creating a service_principal and client_secret using cli is very easy compared to portal.

Creating a Service Principal using the Azure CLI

Firstly, login to the Azure CLI using:
	az login

Once logged in - 
it's possible to list the Subscriptions associated with the account via:	
	az account list

The output (similar to below) will display one or more Subscriptions - 
with the id field being the subscription_id field referenced above.
[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "id": "20000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "isDefault": true,
    "name": "PAYG Subscription",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "10000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "user": {
      "name": "user@example.com",
      "type": "user"
    }
  }
]

Should you have more than one Subscription, 
you can specify the Subscription to use via the following command:
	az account set --subscription="20000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

We can now create the Service Principal which will have permissions 
to manage resources in the specified Subscription using the following command:
	az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/20000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

This command will output 5 values:
{
  "appId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "displayName": "azure-cli-2017-06-05-10-41-15",
  "name": "http://azure-cli-2017-06-05-10-41-15",
  "password": "0000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "tenant": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}

These values map to the Terraform variables like so:

appId is the client_id defined above.
password is the client_secret defined above.
tenant is the tenant_id defined above.

Finally, it's possible to test these values work as expected by first logging in:
	az login --service-principal -u CLIENT_ID -p CLIENT_SECRET --tenant TENANT_ID

Once logged in as the Service Principal - we should be able to list the VM sizes by specifying an Azure region, 
for example here we use the West US region:	
	az vm list-sizes --location westus
	az account list-locations

Finally, since we're logged into the Azure CLI as a Service Principal we recommend logging out of the Azure CLI 
(but you can instead log in using your user account):
	az logout
